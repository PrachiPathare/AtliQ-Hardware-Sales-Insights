# AtliQ-Hardware-Sales-Insights
All client, product, market, and sales transaction data is stored in the MySQL database. This database was examined, and after that, Tableau was connected to it. To prepare the data to build our dashboard in Tableau, I ran ETL and data cleaning processes. then designed a sophisticated dashboard that will enable us to gather insights about sales and profit ffor the Atliq hardware company.
The following file contains two dashboards 1. For Revenue Analysis 2. For Profit Analysis.
